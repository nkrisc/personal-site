### Me
I am UX professional living in Chicago, IL. I have experience in service design, transactional e-commerce experiences, online membership experiences, and design strategy. Iâ€™ve worked collaboratively with many talented people in various disciplines to bring great experiences to the web.

### The Site
This site serves as my personal space to share some of the highlights of my profressional experience. I may also from time to time post my thoughts on topics that interest me.

### The Design
I designed this site with a simple purpose in mind and I designed it to simply fulfill that purpose: share information. I hope I am doing my part in helping reduce the bloat of the web by presenting this site to you with only the most basic elements necessary. May your pages load fast.

This site's styles are based off of [Writ](https://writ.cmcenroe.me/) by Curtis McEnroe.
